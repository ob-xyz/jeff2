        <h2><span>Privacy Policy.</span><br />Effective: September 1, 2025.</h2>
        <p>Jeffamazon respects your privacy and values your trust. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how we collect and use your information and explains your rights and options. This Policy applies to these services (which we call the “Services” in this Policy):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>websites, the Jeffamazon Store, paid products</li>
          <li>newsletters and other disseminated content</li>
          <li>merchandise, mobile apps and related social media pages</li>
          <li>anywhere else we gather information about you and refer to this Policy.</li>  
        </ul>
        <p>This Policy is grouped into these sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>about us and this Policy;</li>
          <li>information we collect</li>
          <li>how we use information, including for advertising purposes;</li>
          <li>when we disclose information to other parties, including for advertising purposes; and</li>
          <li>your rights and how to exercise them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to read this Policy carefully. If you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com">privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com</a>.</p>
        <p>1. About This Policy And Us</p>
        <p>(a)Who we are</p>
        <p>Jeffamazon, Inc. (“Jeffamazon,” “we”, “our” or “us”) operates the Services. This Policy supplements and is governed by our Terms of Service (“Terms”). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy are defined in our Terms. The Terms describe how the Services work in general and its conditions and requirements of use.</p>
        <p>(b) When this Policy applies</p>
        <p>This Policy applies when you use the Services, effective as of the Last Updated date above. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy and the Terms.</p>
        <p>Because the Services change often, this Policy may change over time. Anytime we modify the Policy, we will post a revised version on the Services and update the Last Updated date above. If you have given us your contact information, we will notify you before any material changes take effect, so you have time to review them.</p>
        <p>Certain parts of the Services work differently, and some information falls outside this Policy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Certain parts of the Services may have additional terms and privacy disclosures that supplement this Policy.</li>
          <li>The Services may contain links to and from third-party websites and services. This Policy doesn’t apply to outside of our Services. See Third Party Services to learn more.</li>
          <li>If you are a current or former employee or contractor of ours, this Policy does not apply to you. You may contact us about your privacy practices and rights at <a href="mailto:privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com">privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com</a>.</li>
          <li>If we receive your information in our role as a service provider to another business, our agreement with that business governs our use of your information. We will refer any questions or concerns of yours to that business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(c) Location-specific sections</p>
        <p>The Services operates from the United States, but this Policy applies worldwide. Our practices generally do not differ based on your location, but your rights and choices depend in part on the law where you live. For example, you may have rights under: (1) “GDPR”: <i>THE EU GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (EU) 2016/679, AND THE UK GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (UK GDPR) AS TAILORED BY THE DATA PROTECTION ACT 2018</i>; or (2) “CCPA”: the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended.</p>
        <p>As a result, certain sections of this Policy apply to you only if you reside in a particular location:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Residents of jurisdictions where GDPR applies – such as U.K., EU and Swiss residents – should consult the Rights under GDPR and International Data Transfers sections.</li>
          <li>Residents of Mexico should consult the Aviso de Privacidad addendum.</li>
          <li>Canadian residents should consult the Canadian users section.</li>
          <li>California residents should consult the Rights under California law section. If you reside in a U.S. jurisdiction that has enacted a data privacy law similar to CCPA or GDPR, we extend the same rights CCPA grants to California residents to you, except where we specify otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If those sections apply to you, they override any contrary descriptions elsewhere in the Policy as they relate to you. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com">privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com</a> if you have questions about your rights under other data privacy laws.</p>
