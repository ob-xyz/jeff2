About This Policy And Us</p>\n        <p>(a)Who we are</p>\n        <p>Jeffamazon, Inc. (\u201CJeffamazon,\u201D \u201Cwe\u201D, \u201Cour\u201D or \u201Cus\u201D) operates the Services. This Policy supplements and is governed by our Terms of Service (\u201CTerms\u201D). Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy are defined in our Terms. The Terms describe how the Services work in general and its conditions and requirements of use.</p>\n        <p>(b) When this Policy applies</p>\n        <p>This Policy applies when you use the Services, effective as of the Last Updated date above. By using or accessing the Services, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy and the Terms.</p>\n        <p>Because the Services change often, this Policy may change over time. Anytime we modify the Policy, we will post a revised version on the Services and update the Last Updated date above. If you have given us your contact information, we will notify you before any material changes take effect, so you have time to review them.</p>\n        <p>Certain parts of the Services work differently, and some information falls outside this Policy:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Certain parts of the Services may have additional terms and privacy disclosures that supplement this Policy.</li>\n          <li>The Services may contain links to and from third-party websites and services. This Policy doesn\u2019t apply to outside of our Services. See Third Party Services to learn more.</li>\n          <li>If you are a current or former employee or contractor of ours, this Policy does not apply to you. You may contact us about your privacy practices and rights at <a href=\"mailto:privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com\">privacyrequest@jeffamazon.com</a>.</li>\n          <li>If we receive your information in our role as a service provider to another business, our agreement with that business governs our use of your information. We will refer any questions or concerns of yours to that business.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>(c) Location-specific sections</p>\n        <p>The Services operates from the United States, but this Policy applies worldwide.
